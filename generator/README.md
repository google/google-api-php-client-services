You can generate a client service not preferred in the [directory list](https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis) with the generate script:

```
bin/generate 'https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/drive/v2/rest' DriveV2
```

This makes it easy to access a sandbox API or an active API that has been replaced by a newer version.
